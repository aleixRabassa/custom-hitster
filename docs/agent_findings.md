# Claude Code Findings

This file is maintained by Claude Code. Append relevant discoveries, gotchas, implicit conventions, or non-obvious behaviors found while working in this repository.

## Instructions for Claude Code

- **Always include a date** (ISO 8601, e.g. `2026-03-03`) on each finding entry.
- **Record conclusions from any significant analysis** — if you investigated a non-trivial problem, traced an error, or explored an unfamiliar area of the codebase, summarize what you learned so future Claude Code sessions don't repeat the same work.
- Keep entries concise but self-contained: include enough context that a future Claude Code session can act on the finding without re-reading the full investigation.
- Entries may be edited or removed if the information is no longer valid, but **always confirm with the user first** before doing so.
- When adding a new finding, inform the user that you did so.

## 2026-08-04 — Spotify embed payload re-verified live; Phase 0's inventory still holds

Re-confirmed the Phase 0 field inventory (`plan.md` §5) against the live endpoint before writing the
Phase 2 adapter, since the endpoint is unofficial and unversioned. Fetched
`open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/{id}` with a browser `User-Agent` for Today's Top Hits
(`37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`), Rock Classics (`37i9dQZF1DWXRqgorJj26U`), and a deliberately nonexistent
but well-formed ID (`0000000000000000000000`). Everything Phase 2 depends on is unchanged:

- Payload still at `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">` → `props.pageProps.state.data.entity`.
- **The 200-means-not-found trap is real and current.** The bogus ID returned **HTTP 200** with
  `pageProps` keys `status, title, description, links, rtl, …` and **no `state` key**
  (`status: 404`, `title: "Page not found"`). Branching on the HTTP status would hand the UI an empty
  deck for a bad link. This is the single most important thing in the adapter.
- Track-level keys identical to Phase 0: `uri, uid, title, subtitle, isExplicit, isNineteenPlus,
contentRatings, duration, isPlayable, playabilityReason, audioPreview, entityType`. Still **no album
  name and no release year at track level**, so MusicBrainz remains the only year source.
- Playlist-level keys now also include `authors`, `hasVideo`, `relatedEntityUri` and `type`, which
  Phase 0 did not list. Additive only — nothing the adapter reads has moved or changed. `releaseDate`
  is still `null`.
- Rock Classics still returns exactly **100** tracks (the cap) and Today's Top Hits **50**, so
  `MAX_EMBED_TRACKS = 100` and the truncation-flag approach still hold. Still no total/offset/`hasMore`.
- `audioPreview.url` present on 150/150 tracks sampled; `isPlayable` true on all 150.
- The anonymous bearer token is still at `state.settings.session.accessToken` — i.e. the payload must
  never be forwarded to the client, which is why `/api/playlist` returns only normalized cards.

## 2026-08-04 — Is `api/_lib/` routed by Vercel? (probe deployed, answer pending)

`api/_lib/_probe.ts` was added as a throwaway probe: a **named** export with **no default**, which is
the shape that breaks if Vercel builds it as a function. The whole `api/_lib/` helper convention
(`plan.phase-2-playlist.md` decisions 3/3a) depends on `_`-prefixed paths being excluded from function
routing, and **no local check can tell**: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build` and `format:check` are
all green either way, because none of them know what Vercel's router does. Answer expected from the
developer's next deploy — the two things to confirm are that the function build succeeded and that
`/api/_lib/_probe` returns 404 (not 200, not 500). **This entry must be updated with the result, and
the probe file deleted, once the deploy has run.** If it turns out to be routed, the documented
fallback is a root-level `server/` tree added to `tsconfig.api.json`'s `include`.
